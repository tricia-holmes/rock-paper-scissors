# ✨ Sailor Scout Battle! ✨


## Abstract: 

I created a rock, paper, scissors game with a `Sailor Moon` themed twist called ✨**Sailor Scout Battle!✨**

- Players will be greeted to a home page with an illuminating moon and stars background and upon  `clicking` in the app will be able to hear an `8bit` version of the `Sailor Moon` theme song (this song will be stuck in my head for the rest of the life lol)

- There are two game modes to **Sailor Scout Battle**, `classic` and `difficult.`

### Classic Mode 🌊 🔥 🌙

- If a player chooses to play `classic` mode, they will be taken to the classic game page (dark purple background) and see `three fighters` for their battle. 

- The fighters for classic are:

    Sailor Mercury 🌊, 
    Sailor Mars 🔥, 
    and Sailor Moon 🌙. 

- The player's side will be on the left and their score will be kept in the `wins` under`Human 🌙`. 

- The opponent is a computer and their score will be kept on the right side in the `wins` under `Computer 👾`. 

- In order to start a round, a player must select the `fighter` of their choice by clicking on one of the Sailor Scouts in the center of the page. Once a player has selected a fighter, then the round will play out. 

- The player's fighter will go up against the computer's fighter and will see who wins by watching the `fighters` battle in the middle. 

- Whoever `attacks` wins and whoever `falls` loses. The winner will then `celebrate` 🎉 

- If it's a `draw`, the fighters will stand idly by waiting for another scout battle to commence. 

- The results will also be displayed in the `subtitle` under `Classic Battle`.

- After a round had been played the `wins` will be updated for the winner and the board will reset. It's now time to play another round!

- Want to change it up? There's a `Change Game?` button in the bottom right-hand corner. A player can click on this button to go back to the `home page` and select a different game mode.

### Difficult Mode 🌊 🔥 🌙 🪨 ⚡️

- If a player chooses to play `difficult` mode, they will be taken to the difficult game page (pastel purple blue background) and see `five fighters` for their battle. 

- The game is setup the same as `classic` with more fighters to choose from and more outcomes to happen.
